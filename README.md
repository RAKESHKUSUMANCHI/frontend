I choose frontend project to develop.I used technologies like Node.js,ejs,express,mongoose to develop this project on server side.I haven't deployed this website yet.

As soon as we register/login ,we gonna enter home page where a meme template gonna automatically generated. If we dont like the tempplate,we can click on 'get anotheer' button to generate another meme template manually.
As soon as we like the template we can insert text on either top or bottom or both using 'insert' button.Then we dawnload the  image by 'download' button.we can end our session by clicking 'logout' button.

I developed all required properties like automatically generating meme,inserting text on top and bottom of meme,user authentication,downloading meme.and i failed to develop user saved memes and shharing meme across social media due to lack of time.

I choose frontend project to develop.I used technologies like Node.js,ejs,express,mongoose to develop this project on server side.I haven't deployed this website yet.

As soon as we register/login ,we gonna enter home page where a meme template gonna automatically generated. If we dont like the template,we can click on 'get anotheer' button to generate another meme template automatically.
As soon as we like the template we can insert text on either top or bottom or both using 'insert' button.Then we download the  image by 'download' button.I used html2canvas method to do so.we can end our session by clicking 'logout' button.

I developed all required properties like automatically generating meme,inserting text on top and bottom of meme,user authentication,downloading meme.and i failed to develop user saved memes and sharing meme across social media due to lack of time.
